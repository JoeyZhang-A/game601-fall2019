The player has a number called hunger. The hunger of the player is 0.

Every turn:
		now the hunger of the player is the hunger of the player + 1;
		say "The player is [hunger of the player] hungry."

Every turn when the hunger of the player is greater than 3:
		say "HUMGRRRYYYYGYGYTYYY!!!!";
		
Every turn when the player is in the Game Lab:
		now the hunger of the player is the hunger of the player - 5;
		say "The wisdom of those who came before you has satiated you.";

Instead of asking Dr K about "laptop cart":
		say "Dr K, with a twinkle in his eye, says 'here, let me give you this key.'";
		now the player is holding the key;
		

After opening the laptop cart:
		say "Nice! I can finally steal all these laptops.";
